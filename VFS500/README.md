# VFS500-5-1001

## Sensor Information

### Sensor Output
- Flow rate [GPM (gallons per minute)], range: 0.26[GPM] to 5.28[GPM]   (data[1])
- Frequency [Hz]    (data[0])

### Sensor Use
- This sensor monitors the flowrate. 

### Code Description
1. flowrate is calculated by proportionally mapping the output of the sensor to the range of the sensor. 
2. The calculated flowrate is returned
