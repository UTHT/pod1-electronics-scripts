# Prosense SPT25-20-0200A

## Sensor Information

### Sensor Output
- Pressure [psi], range: 0[psi] to 200[psi]

### Sensor Use
- This sensor monitors  sensors monitor the pressure of the braking exhaust valves, alerting the team in case of any irregularity. 

### Code Description
1. Current is calculated by proportionally mapping the analogy input from the arduino(4-20mA) over the working pressure range(0-200psi).
2. The calculated pressure is returned
