**MPU9250.h**
Sensor functions

**arduinoFFT.h**
One of the standard Arduino libraries that can be downloaded from Arduino Library Manager.
This computes the vibrational frequencies.

**quaternionFilters.h**
Currently unused, but it is included just in case it will be used.
A section of the Arduino sensor testing code is written to use these functions, however a simpler alternatived was chosen instead (the one that is currently used).
